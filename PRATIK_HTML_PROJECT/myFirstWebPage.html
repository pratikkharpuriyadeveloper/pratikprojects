        <h1>Flowers Information</h1>

    <p> flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
        division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs  sepals that enclose and protect
        the developing flower, petals that attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which
        in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen
        grains produced in the anthers.</p>

    <h2>Lotus</h2>

    <p>Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas.<br> Stands of lotus
        drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately and most
        are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts
        in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant
        seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony.</p>

    <h2>Rose</h2>

    <p>The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea,<br> which
        usually have only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a
        few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa
        sericea, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points
        alternating with the rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[8] Roses are
        insect-pollinated in nature.</p>

    <h2>Sunflower</h2>

    <p>everal perennial Helianthus species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and<br> can
        become aggressive. On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, Helianthus verticillatus, was listed as an
        endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the
        Endangered Species Act. The primary threats are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia,
        and Tennessee. They grow to 1.8 metres (6 feet) and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and
        moist, prairie-like areas.[9]</p>

    <h2>Hibiscus</h2>
    <p>The genus includes both annual and perennial herbaceous plants, as well as woody shrubs and small trees. <br>The
        generic name is derived from the Greek name ἰβίσκος (ibískos) which Pedanius Dioscorides gave to Althaea
        officinalis (c. 40–90 AD).[4][5]

        Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus
        rosa-sinensis.[6]

        A tea made from the flowers of Hibiscus sabdariffa is known by many names around the world and is served both
        hot and cold. <br>The beverage is known for its red colour, tart flavour, and vitamin C content.</p>
