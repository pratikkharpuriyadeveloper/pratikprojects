    <h1>Types of flowering plant species around the world</h1>
    <p>the characteristic reproductive structure of angiosperms. As popularly used, the term “flower” especially applies
        when part or all of the reproductive structure is distinctive in colour and form.

        petunia
        petunia
        Pink variegated flowers of a common garden petunia
        lilac
        lilac
        Common lilac (Syringa vulgaris).
        In their range of colour, size, form, and anatomical arrangement, flowers present a seemingly endless variety of
        combinations. They range in size from minute blossoms to giant blooms. In some plants, such as poppy, magnolia,
        tulip, and petunia, each flower is relatively large and showy and is produced singly, while in other plants,
        such as aster, snapdragon, and lilac, the individual flowers may be very small and are borne in a distinctive
        cluster known as an inflorescence. Regardless of their variety, all flowers have a uniform function, the
        reproduction of the species through the production of seed.
